## SPIN Rules - Get Data Tabular

### Question: How to query a SPIN rule?

SPIN rules, like the one for the MedDRA extract are modeled. How can this spin rule query be executed to receive the content? Same we have for domain load, don't we? Or do I have to reconstruct the query and execute this?

## MedDRA Mapping

### Question: How to deal with quotes in string?

There seems to be three LLT codes having a quote in the label, e.g. Feeling "cool". The R program removes all quotes, so the string would be 'Feeling cool', currently the SAS program uses the masking of \" to mask the quote. Which way should we go?
