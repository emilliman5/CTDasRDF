## Code.ttl - Prefix differences code: vs sdtmterm:

**Question**: I guess we use "code:" as prefix for cutstom code items and "sdtmterm:" for CDISC codelists? Extensible codelists are also maintained under "code:", even though the values might be CDISC Terminology for our pilot? Or should we include all CDISC terms with the "sdtmterm:" prefix instead? How would it look like for having CDISC code + extensions? These extensions are typically company specific.

Example: code:AgeGroup uses the code prefix but only CDISC terminology for the extended codelist.
