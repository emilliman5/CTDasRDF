# CTDasRDF
This repository holds the scripts and data for the PhUSE project "Clinical Trials Data as RDF." This is a work in progress. Expect 3rr0rs, inconsistencies, and occasional mayhem. 

Your best source for project documentation is the CTDasRDF.rmd/html file. Clone the repository and view the .html file, or recreate the .html by knitting the rmd file.

# Obtaining project files
Github novices should download the files: 
Click "Clone or Download" and select "Download Zip"
Extract the file to a location like  C:\\_github
This will create the folder C:\\_github\\CTDasRDF-MASTER and subfolders. You will need to edit the paths in some files to get things running. 

```
Contact the project leads for additional information.
