# CTDasRDF
This repository holds the scripts and data for the PhUSE project "Clinical Trials Data as RDF." The project is ongoing and documentation will lag behind other repository content. 

Project documentation is created in Markdown (.rmd) files located in the folder **CTDasRDF/doc** . Clone the repository and view the .html file, or recreate the .html by knitting the rmd files.

# Obtaining project files
Github novices should download the files: 
Click "Clone or Download" and select "Download Zip"
Extract the file to a location like  C:\\_github
This will create the folder C:\\_github\\CTDasRDF-MASTER and subfolders. You will need to edit the paths in some files to get things running. 

```
Contact the project leads Tim Williams or Armando Oliva for additional information.
