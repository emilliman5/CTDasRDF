# CTDasRDF
This repository holds the scripts and data for the PhUSE project "Clinical Trials Data as RDF." All work is very early draft, contains errors, problems with the model, etc. 

Details on Installation, configuration, R Scripts, process flow, data, and other files is being moved from the Github project Wiki to the R Markdown file in the root folder.  
The Project Wiki https://github.com/phuse-org/CTDasRDF/wiki will be depreciated in favor of R Markdown in the coming weeks. .
