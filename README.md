# CTDasRDF
This repository holds the scripts and data for the PhUSE project "Clinical Trials Data as RDF." All work is very early draft, contains errors, problems with the model, etc. 

The Project Wiki https://github.com/phuse-org/CTDasRDF/wiki will be depreciated in favor of R Markdown in the coming weeks. Installation & configuration instructions, R script descriptions, process flow, and other file descriptions are moving from the Github project Wiki to the R Markdown file in the root folder.  
 
# Obtaining project files
If you are not experienced with Github cloning it will be easiest to obtain a copy of the project files using the Download Zip option:
Click "Clone or Download" and select "Download Zip"
Extract the file to a location like  C:\\_github
This will create the folder C:\\_github\\CTDasRDF-MASTER and subfolders.
Edit the paths where needed to specify your checkout location.  Example:
 ```
 setwd("C:/_github/CTDasRDF-MASTER")
```
Contact the project leads or see the wiki for how to run the R scripts, visualizations, etc.
