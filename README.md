# CTDasRDF
This repository holds the scripts and data for the PhUSE project "Clinical Trials Data as RDF." All work is very early draft, contains errors, problems with the model, etc. 

Your best source for project documentation is the CTDasRDF.rmd/html file. Clone the repository and view the .html file, or recreate the .html by knitting the rmd file. Chrome is the preferred browser (to enable view of the R Script flowchart created using DiagrammeR).
