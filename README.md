# CTDasRDF
This repository holds the scripts and data for the PhUSE project "Clinical Trials Data as RDF." Leads for the project are Tim Williams (NovasTaylor) and Armando Oliva (aolivamd).

# Documentation
[Table of Content](doc/TableOfContent.md) - Start here!  **NOTE**: Reworking content November/December 2018. 

Project documentation format is Github Markdown, created from R (.rmd) files and stored in the **/doc**/ subfolder. Documentation will lag behind development due to the ongoing nature of the project.

# Obtaining project files
Github novices should download the files: 
Click "Clone or Download" and select "Download Zip"
Extract the file to a location like  C:\\_github
This will create the folder C:\\_github\\CTDasRDF-MASTER and subfolders. You will need to edit the paths in some files to get things running.   
Contact the project leads if you would like to become a contributor.
